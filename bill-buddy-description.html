        <h2>🔧 Core Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Host or Join a Bill</strong><br>
                Users can create a new bill session as a host or join an existing one using a unique 6-character code. It's quick, secure, and doesn't require sign-in from every participant.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Real-Time Item Selection</strong><br>
                Everyone in the session can see the full itemized receipt and mark what they ordered. As selections are made, the entire group sees the updates in real time—no need to refresh or guess.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Smart Splitting</strong><br>
                Tax and tip are automatically divided based on item totals. Our smart logic ensures that shared items are split fairly and optional rounding keeps totals clean.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Instant Summary</strong><br>
                At the bottom of each bill, Bill Buddy generates a clear summary of what each person owes, including a breakdown of food, tax, and tip. One tap and everyone knows their share.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>One-Tap Payback</strong><br>
                When the bill is settled, participants can choose from preset payment options (Venmo, Zelle, Apple Pay, etc.) to send their share directly to the host. No more "I'll get you later."
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bill History</strong><br>
                The <strong>User tab</strong> keeps a full history of all the bills you've hosted or joined, with the date, restaurant name (optional), and total paid. The <strong>Friends tab</strong> allows you to connect with others and track shared activity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>🤖 Built-in AI Assistance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Auto-suggests item splits for large groups</li>
            <li>Detects possible mistakes or imbalances in who's paying for what</li>
            <li>Learns your habits (e.g., your favorite dish or preferred tip %), making future bill-splitting even faster</li>
            <li>Predicts group fairness using bill history and ordering patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Whether you're hosting or joining, Bill Buddy makes sure you're always being treated fairly—without having to do the math.
